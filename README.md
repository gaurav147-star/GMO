# React Internship Assignment: Vite Application

 Explore the culmination of my React Internship Assignmentâ€”a dynamic Vite application. Witness Vite's speed and MUI's elegance harmonize to craft an exceptional user experience. From user data management to intricate UI components, this project showcases my React proficiency. Dive in and experience innovation in action.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Application Configuration

I successfully created a new React application using Typescript and Vite. I configured the application with MUI by following the [MUI getting started guide](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/).

### Task 2: First Page of the Application

I implemented a user information form on the first page. The form collects the user's Name, Phone number, and Email. After completing the form, the user's details are saved in local storage. I also implemented routing to the second page and ensured that users are redirected back to the first page if they access the second page without providing necessary information.

### Task 3: Second Page of the Application (Component 1)

I successfully fetched a list of JSON data from an API (e.g., https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts). I converted the JSON data into TypeScript models/interfaces and displayed the data in a table using the [MUI Data Grid](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/).

### Task 4: Second Page of the Application (Component 2)

I created a new component to display department and sub-department information. I used the provided JSON data (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uQCFny5aXfMD9v2TPy3rbE8EHw-xZVdZfj4g-2Yv6IU/edit?usp=sharing) and successfully implemented the expand/collapse functionality for sub-departments. Users can select departments and sub-departments, and the UI handles automatic selection of related items according to the requirements.
